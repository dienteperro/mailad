This document contains the guidelines for MailAD Translations

## Goal

The mail goal is to stablish the guidelines for contributing translations to languages other than English. This should avoid duplicity of work and loss of time.

At the begining the focus will be the documentation. 

## Guidelines

This are the main ones, it can change with time:

0. The translations must be done in a new file from the original adding the [two letter language code](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) to the name, so for Spanish `README.md` will be `README.es.md` the new files must be placed under the `i18n` directory.
0. You must start with the original file and only translate the explanatory text, don't translate the texts inside a code block as it's a software generated one, that must remain in the original language.
0. All documentation translations PR must be made against the `development` branch, I will be responsible for revision and merging.
0. Please just make a PR when you have a translation of a document in full, avoid to send partial translations, this will waste your time and mine.
0. You can claim the authorship of a translation, you can insert a hidden line like the one on top of this document with your data, I will respect them when you send it _(this line will not be shown via web but yes locally)_
0. When you intend to start a translation please go to [issue #10](https://github.com/stdevPavelmc/mailad/issues/10) and check if no other person is working on that document and language.
